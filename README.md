##Project requiernments
Test Task: Basic DOTS Multiplayer
1. Maximum of two players âœ… (sends rejection and disconnects extra client)

8. Naming should follow Microsoft conventions (C# identifier naming rules and conventions) âœ…

Optional:
- Matchmaking
- Add a basic attack and HP, or coin collection, or possibly a chat system (anything that expands the above requirements and requires network synchronization)

##Current project state
1. Animations still don't work
2. Code needs a bit of cleanup from debugs and my learning curve
3. Still have to build the server and client, but I leave it for last since it will take eternity
4. I don't know if it's the connection, the code or my poor old CPU but I get a ton of Large serverTick prediction errors

##My work process
I only knew the theory of DOTS and nothing about Netcode for Entities, so I started with YouTube Tutorials (mainly Code Monkey and Turbo Makes Games). Drowned in them for about 2 days and went through at least 5 fresh unity projects before it started making sense. Even spent like 3 hours the first day trying to fix a piece of code that turned out to be a missclick mistake. Very nostalgic.

Then when I got the basics of server/client connections and baking, entities, authoring and ghosts I started a clean project, which is in this repo.

Currently, the biggest issue is the animator, which I can't get to work coz I don't understend entities enough right now, but I'm getting there. Other than that, I still have to cap the player number, but that should be quick. And the client/server connection can be a bit laggy, giving me a load of tick warnings on one run and then being fine the next. So I should probably fix that.

All in all I think it's pretty good considering I started on this last Wednesdey.
